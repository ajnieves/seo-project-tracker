# Deploying SEO Projects Tracker

This document provides instructions for deploying the SEO Projects Tracker application to various platforms.

## Deploying to Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)

Vercel is the platform created by the team behind Next.js and offers the most seamless deployment experience for Next.js applications.

### Prerequisites

1. A [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) account
2. A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account (you can sign up using your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push your code to a Git repository**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
   - Initialize Git in your project folder (if not already done):
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```
   - Add your remote repository and push:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
     git push -u origin main
     ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in
   - Click "Add New" > "Project"
   - Import your Git repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project
   - Configure your project settings if needed (environment variables, build settings, etc.)
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy your application
   - Once deployed, you'll receive a URL for your application (e.g., `https://seo-project-tracker.vercel.app`)

3. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" > "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain and follow the instructions to configure DNS settings

## Deploying to Netlify

Netlify is another popular platform for deploying web applications.

### Prerequisites

1. A [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) account
2. A [Netlify](https://netlify.com) account (you can sign up using your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push your code to a Git repository** (same as for Vercel)

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign in
   - Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
   - Connect to your Git provider and select your repository
   - Configure build settings:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will build and deploy your application
   - Once deployed, you'll receive a URL for your application

3. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - In your Netlify project dashboard, go to "Domain settings"
   - Add your custom domain and follow the instructions to configure DNS settings

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

For static exports of Next.js applications.

1. **Configure Next.js for static export**
   - Add the following to your `next.config.js`:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       output: 'export',
     }
     ```

2. **Add a deploy script to package.json**
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "deploy": "next build && next export && touch out/.nojekyll"
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy using GitHub Actions**
   - Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with GitHub Actions configuration for deploying to GitHub Pages

## Deploying to a VPS or Cloud Provider

For more control over your deployment, you can deploy to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean.

1. **Build your application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Use a process manager like PM2**
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start npm --name "seo-project-tracker" -- start
   ```

4. **Set up a reverse proxy with Nginx or Apache**
   - Configure Nginx or Apache to proxy requests to your Next.js application
   - Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt

## Environment Variables

If your application uses environment variables, make sure to configure them on your deployment platform:

- Vercel: Project Settings > Environment Variables
- Netlify: Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment
- GitHub Pages: Secrets in GitHub Actions
- VPS: Set in your server environment or use a `.env` file

## Continuous Deployment

Both Vercel and Netlify support continuous deployment, automatically rebuilding and redeploying your application when you push changes to your Git repository.
