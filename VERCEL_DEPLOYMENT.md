# Deploying to Vercel

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your SEO Projects Tracker application to Vercel.

## Why Vercel?

Vercel is the platform created by the team behind Next.js and offers the most seamless deployment experience for Next.js applications. Benefits include:

- Zero configuration required for Next.js apps
- Automatic HTTPS
- Global CDN
- Continuous deployment from Git
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Serverless functions support
- Free tier available

## Prerequisites

1. A [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) account
2. Your project code pushed to a Git repository
3. A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account (you can sign up using your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Your Code to GitHub

If you haven't already, push your code to a GitHub repository:

```bash
# Initialize Git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to Git
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add remote repository (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/seo-project-tracker.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Sign Up for Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel's website](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Choose to sign up with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket (preferably the same service where your repository is hosted)
4. Complete the sign-up process

### 3. Import Your Project

1. Once logged in to Vercel, click "Add New..." > "Project"
2. Select the Git provider where your repository is hosted
3. Grant Vercel permission to access your repositories if prompted
4. Find and select your SEO Projects Tracker repository

### 4. Configure Project Settings

Vercel will automatically detect that your project is a Next.js application and pre-fill most settings:

1. **Project Name**: You can keep the default or customize it
2. **Framework Preset**: Should be automatically set to Next.js
3. **Root Directory**: Leave as `.` if your project is in the root of the repository
4. **Build and Output Settings**: These should be automatically configured for Next.js

### 5. Environment Variables (Optional)

If your application uses environment variables:

1. Expand the "Environment Variables" section
2. Add any required environment variables for your production deployment

### 6. Deploy

1. Click "Deploy"
2. Vercel will build and deploy your application
3. Once completed, you'll receive a URL for your deployed application (e.g., `https://seo-project-tracker.vercel.app`)

## Post-Deployment

### Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" > "Domains"
2. Click "Add" and enter your domain name
3. Follow the instructions to configure your DNS settings

### Continuous Deployment

Vercel automatically sets up continuous deployment:

1. Any push to your main branch will trigger a new production deployment
2. Pull requests will generate preview deployments

### Team Collaboration

To collaborate with others:

1. Go to "Team" in the Vercel dashboard
2. Invite team members by email
3. Set appropriate permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If your deployment fails during the build process:

1. Check the build logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed in your package.json
3. Verify that your application builds successfully locally with `npm run build`

### Runtime Errors

If your application deploys but doesn't work correctly:

1. Check the Function Logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure any environment variables are correctly set
3. Test your application locally with production settings

## Vercel CLI (Optional)

For more advanced workflows, you can use the Vercel CLI:

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Log in to your Vercel account:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```
